# Phantom Ops

Phantom Ops is a minimalist website built to host and share study materials like assignments, notes, and previous-year question papers. It was designed to reduce the hassle of repeatedly sharing the same files with classmates during exam periods. The website started as a simple project but evolved over time as I learned more about web development.

## Overview

Phantom Ops began in August 2024 as a personal project to simplify sharing study resources with my classmates. Instead of repeatedly receiving phone calls and texts for notes and assignments, I built this site where everything could be hosted and downloaded at any time. The website went through multiple iterations as I learned more about web design and backend development, with AI assistance being used extensively for the code generation.

## Features

- Hosts study materials including assignments, notes, and previous exam papers.
- Simple, user-friendly, and minimalist design.
- Direct download links to resources to avoid clogging communication channels.
- Accessible from any device without needing an account.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the front-end design and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For any interactive elements on the site.
- **PHP**: For handling backend processes (flagged as malicious by some free hosting services).
- **Git**: For version control and project management.
- **AI-Generated Code**: Most of the website’s code was written using AI models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the website locally, you need a basic local server setup.

- **PHP** installed on your machine.
- A web server like **Apache** or **XAMPP** (for Windows).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/animeshtheghost/phantomops.git
   ```

2. Move to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd phantomops
   ```

3. Set up a local server using Apache, or upload the project to your preferred hosting provider.

4. Ensure PHP is running and navigate to the website on your browser:

   ```
   http://localhost
   ```

## Usage

Phantom Ops allows easy access to all the study materials in one place. Once hosted, anyone with the link can access and download the files directly without bothering the host.

### Use Cases

- Sharing study notes and resources among classmates.
- Avoiding redundant file sharing and communication overload.
  
## Challenges and Lessons Learned

- **Hosting Issues**: Initially, I faced challenges with free hosting services flagging my PHP files as malicious. I later switched to a more reliable hosting provider.
- **AI Code Generation**: The bulk of the website’s code was generated using AI, which helped me a lot since I'm not a professional coder. However, I still had to manually fix bugs and errors.
- **Learning Git**: While building the backend, I also learned version control with Git, which greatly helped manage the project.
  
## Contributing
